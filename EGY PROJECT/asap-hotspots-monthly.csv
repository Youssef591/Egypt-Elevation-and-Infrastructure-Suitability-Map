The above average biomass conditions suggest overall good performance of both crop and rangelands, however towards the end of the season it becomes also clear that a significant part of the high potential areas along the Nile and in irrigated areas in Al Jazeera, Sennar and White Nile had a significantly shorter crop cycle than in normal years, suggesting limited planting or use of short cycle crops after flood retreat and making below average yields in these regions likely. Also, it remains challenging, based on remote sensing only, to assess the impact of the conflict on agricultural productivity in a season with exceptionally favourable rainfall. Socio economic and conflict related factors including access to fields, availability of farming inputs and labour, will play a key role in the final amount of grain harvested, even if general vegetation conditions appear positive.

It has to be noted however that as in previous situations where drought seasons are followed by flood, recovery of farming takes its time, as for most households, livelihood assets were eroded. Restocking of herds in particular is a multi-years process and the current flooding has led to more livestock losses in addition to those caused by the drought.

The situation is markedly different in the Southern parts of the country affected by drought, where there is widespread crop failure in what is the fifth consecutive rainy season affected by drought. Most of the bimodal areas in southern Oromia, South West Ethiopia, SNNPR received poor Kremit rainfall in September and even worse rainfall in October (Deyr season), leading to poor harvests of cereals and legumes. The drought in southern Ethiopia is also hitting pastoralists hard, with livestock body conditions very low for all types of livestock and high losses expected in the last parts of 2022 and in early 2023 due to the poor Deyr rainfall. According to FEWSNET, although the incoming Meher season production is slightly alleviating food security conditions in parts of western and central Ethiopia, the humanitarian assistance need is expected to remain historically high in Northern, Southern and South-Eastern Ethiopia because of the combination of conflict and drought. Low household income, coupled with high food prices, continue to severely restrict financial access to food among many pastoral households in southern and southeastern Ethiopia.

Gu season planting had started late due to the late onset of the main rains and at the end of the season, cumulated rainfall was still 25%-50% below average in most of the country. Irrigated areas have also provided below average production, including in North-West, as temperatures have been above average for the last 3 months and water levels in the main rivers were reportedly low. In August/September, some off-season crop activity is visible both along the Juba and Shabelle rivers, in line with improved rainfall in the Ethiopian part of the river basins, however this can only partially compensate for the failure of the rain-fed Gu season production. Seasonal rainfall forecasts for the October-December Deyr season are likely to be below average according to the latest Copernicus C3S Multimodel seasonal rainfall forecast maps.

Between June and September 2022, an estimated 4.3 million people (or 26% of the total population) are still experiencing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes, including 121,000 people in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). Current levels of food assistance delivery have increased compared to earlier in the year, reaching an average of 3.1 million people per month between April and June 2022 and 4.5 million people per month between July and September 2022: however, it is expected to be reduce by half in November and December 2022. This means that acute food insecurity and malnutrition are expected to deteriorate further in October to December, with approximately 6.7 million people (41% population) expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes, including 2.2 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and at least 300,560 people that will likely be in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).

On the contrary, March to May rainfall failed in most of the bi-seasonal areas in Coastal, Eastern, Central and Northern Kenya and in pastoral areas in Eastern and Coastal Kenya. Satellite imagery shows that even during the current dry season, vegetation condition appears poorer than usual across parts of Laikipia, Meru, Samburu, as well as in Machakos and Kajado and in Malindi, Kilifi and Kwale. Pastoral vegetation conditions have continued to quickly deteriorate in the East, North and South of the country, causing livestock death and forcing population to trek longer distances for drinking water. For many of these areas a failed 2022 long rains season, continues to lengthen an exceptional sequence of previous drought seasons. For pastoral households in the arid lands, who have already lost part of their livestock this leads to rapid depletion of coping strategies, especially in a context of increasing food and fuel prices due to the economic situation. Acute food insecurity was forecast to rise during the first half of 2022 driven by the damaging effects of a multi-season drought and high food prices. The latest IPC analysis forecasted the number of people in need of food assistance to increase from 3.5 million in July-September (24% of population analyzed) to 4.4 million (29%) in October-December. This includes 1.2 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 3.1 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and is the highest number in the last 13 years.

The southern and eastern parts of the country have experienced below-average rainfall for the fourth consecutive seasons which led to a prolonged dryness and expanding drought condition in some areas across northeastern and significantly reduced rainfall in southwestern and easter part of the country. Below-average rainfall caused widespread delays or no planting across much of typical belg planting areas and the driest pasture conditions (with few-to-no migration options) in central, eastern, and southern Ethiopia. Although most farmers could have completed land preparation by now, access to improved seeds and fertilizer are a major challenge due to conflict in the region. Main season planting is also delayed by dry conditions due to low bel rain and late start of main season rain. The Copernicus multi-model forecasts for JAS point towards a wetter-than-average main crop season, but the late start and initial dryness already represent a high risk of failure. Even if there will be a wetter than average rainfall is expected, rainfall distribution in time and space can be a major concern. In addition, there are first signs of la Nina continuing in the second half of the year with possible failure of Oct-Dec. rainfall, which will further increase pressure on pastoral areas. The dry conditions in pastoral areas over several consecutive season led to further deterioration of animal body conditions, deaths of livestock and a sharp decline in milk production.

The crop season has performed normally in the main producing regions of western Kenya and Rift Valley. Rainfall has improved in December and January in parts of the country, but in many cases came late for crop and rangelands recovery. The late onset of the short rains has delayed land preparation and planting and reduced household access to income from agricultural labor. Furthermore, declining forage and water resources in the pastoral areas continue to intensify atypical livestock migration as herders search for better rangeland resources. Poor pasture and water conditions lead to decline in animals body conditions and negatively affect milk production and consumption, driving Crisis (IPC phase 3) outcomes in pastoral areas, and impacting household access to income and food.

The S2 imagery also shows a clear reduction of the area of flooded (rice) fields at end May 2019 with respect to end May 2018 in the 5 provinces of the rice bowl area (Hwanghae Namdo, Hwanghae Bukto, Pyongyang-Si, Pyongan Namdo and Pyongan Bukto) as a result of the lower water levels of the reservoirs with respect to 2018. It is not clear at this stage if this corresponds to a reduction of the irrigated rice area or to a delayed planting of rice.

In conclusion, although the signs of a reduced 2019 production are very preliminary, the rainfall deficit over the last months in the half southern part of the rice bowl area together with the poor prospect for early crops production and the 2018 poor harvest of main season crops (due to a combination of heat wave in July-August 2018 and floods) place the country in a critical situation with regard to food security, as stressed by the FAO/WFP report of May 2019.",3,0,3,PRK
